# Friend Finder

### Overview

This is a compatibility-based application.  The user takes a survey by answering ten questions and uploads their name and photo.  Upon submitting the survey, the app will match the user with those who's answers are closest to matching the user's.  The data is populated with those who have answered the survey before.  The name and photo of the match will then be displayed as a popup. No phone numbers and emails and other personal information is required.   

### Usefulness

This application is great for those who see companions who most closely align with their views and emotions.  By answering the survey, you will then find a perfect person to hang out with.
